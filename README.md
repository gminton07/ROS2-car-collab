# ROS2-car-collab
Collaboration for ROS2 on PiCar

Please do testing work in a separate branch to avoid corruption in main. I will accept any pull requests for changes. 

## For using as ROS2 package:
Build package with colcon. The repository is the root of a package pi_car.
Next, run individual nodes or launch files with the corresponding ROS2 commands.
